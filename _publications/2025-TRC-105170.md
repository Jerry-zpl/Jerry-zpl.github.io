# Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The study of mixed traffic capacity, involving both Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), remains a critical area of research. Traditional models have typically focused on individual vehicles, while this research shifts the focus to platoons as the fundamental units of analysis to better capture the platooning characteristics of CAVs. Specifically, we introduce a new metric, the Inter-Platoon Platooning Intensity (IPI), to facilitate the analysis of mixed traffic capacity. Through both mathematical and numerical investigations, we evaluate the impact of the proposed IPI and Maximum Platoon Size (MPS) on mixed traffic dynamics. Our findings indicate that: (1) the IPI effectively measures the clustering of CAVs in a single-lane mixed traffic environment; (2) the calculated mixed traffic capacity closely matches the actual traffic capacity, showing only minor deviations; (3) the marginal analysis demonstrates the conditions under which mixed traffic capacity correlates monotonically with either MPS or IPI; and (4) an optimal MPS is determined that maximizes mixed traffic capacity. These insights contribute significantly to the existing literature on the effects of platoon size and platooning intensity on mixed traffic flow.

# Highlights

- A new metric, the Inter-Platoon Platooning Intensity (IPI), is introduced.

- Impact of IPI and Maximum Platoon Size (MPS) is examined on mixed traffic dynamics.

- IPI effectively measures the clustering strength of CAVs in mixed traffic.

- Conditions where capacity rises monotonically with either MPS or IPI are derived.

- The analysis is extended to the development of mixed traffic fundamental diagram.

# Assumptions

- The assumptions in this study follows the **MPS constraint model** in our [previous study](https://jerry-zpl.github.io/publication/2025-TRE-104130).

- The primary objective of this study is to model the capacity of a single-lane road within a mixed traffic environment. Accordingly, each headway in this study represents the minimum headway between vehicles traveling at the design speed.

# Platoon Centric Approach

- This study considers the CAV platoon as the fundamental unit of analysis, where HVs (modeled as '0') and CAV platoons (modeled as '1') form the platoon sequence:

- Inter-platoon Platooning Intensity (IPI): For any platoon sequence $$\mathbb{M}: \{x_i\},\,i \in [1,\,M]$$, based on the first-order unbiased ACF, the proposed IPI, denoted as $$\rho$$, can be formulated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho 
&= 
\frac{\displaystyle \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{i=1}^{\,M-1} (x_i - \bar{x})\,\bigl(x_{i+1} - \bar{x}\bigr)}
     {\displaystyle \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{\,M} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}\\
\bar{x} 
&= 
\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\,M} x_i}{M}
\;=\;
\frac{\displaystyle M\,q_{0}\cdot 0 \;+\; M\,q_{1}\cdot 1}{M}
\;=\; q_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

 **Where:**  
  - $$q_0$$ denotes the **proportion of HVs** in a **platoon sequence**.  
  - $$q_1$$ denotes the **proportion of CAV Platoons** in a **platoon sequence**.

# Capacity Analysis

- Headway Types:

  ![2](\images\2025-TRC-2.png)

- Estimated Capacity:

$$
  \hat{C} \approx \frac{1}{h}
  \;=\;
  \frac{1}
  {
    \alpha_{\mathrm{HV\text{-}HV}}
    \;+\;
    \beta \, h_{\mathrm{plt\text{-}HV}}
    \;+\;
    \beta \, h_{\mathrm{HV\text{-}plt}}
    \;+\;
    \gamma \, h_{\mathrm{plt\text{-}plt}}
    \;+\;
    \delta \, h_{\mathrm{CAV\text{-}CAV}}
  }
  $$

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  &\alpha = (1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}})\,\bigl[\rho\,(1 - P_{0}) + P_{0}\bigr] \\[6pt]
  &\beta = (1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}})\,(1 - P_{0})\,(1 - \rho) \\[6pt]
  &\gamma = \frac{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}{P_{0}}\;(1 - P_{0})\;\bigl(\rho\,P_{0} + 1 - P_{0}\bigr) \\[6pt]
  &\delta = 1 \;-\; \frac{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}{P_{0}} \\[6pt]
  &P_{0} = \frac{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{\,L}\,}{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{\,L} + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  **Where:**  
  - $$P_{\mathrm{CAV}}$$ denotes the **CAV penetration rate**.  
  - $$L$$ denotes the **maximum platoon size**.
