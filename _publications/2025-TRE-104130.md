# Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In a mixed traffic environment that consists of both Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), the platoon sizes of CAVs play a significant role in traffic flow analysis. However, the statistical properties of these platoon sizes have not been thoroughly addressed in existing research. This study aims to fill this critical gap by modeling CAV platoon sizes as a random variable, analyzing scenarios both with and without a Maximum Platoon Size (MPS) constraint. Specifically, the frequencies and corresponding probability distributions of CAV platoon sizes under these conditions are derived. Furthermore, the distribution derivations are extended by incorporating platooning willingness. Through numerical analysis, the results reveal that the proposed probability distributions align closely with numerical observations, demonstrating the consistency and reliability of the model. The study also explores the characteristics of these distributions, as well as the effects of the MPS constraint and platooning willingness. By examining the platooning behaviors in mixed traffic and providing analytical derivations for CAV platoon size probability distributions, this research lays a robust mathematical foundation for further analysis of mixed traffic dynamics, enhancing traffic management and efficiency in increasingly automated traffic environments.

# Highlights

- This paper unveils the statistical properties of CAV platoon sizes in mixed traffic.

- Accounting for scenarios with or without Maximum Platoon Size (MPS).

- The frequencies and distributions of various CAV platoon sizes are formulated.

- Distribution derivations are extended to incorporate platooning willingness.

- The corresponding probability distributions are derived and verified by numerical studies.

# Assumptions

- Only two classes of vehicles are considered, i.e., CAVs and HVs, which are randomly distributed on a single-lane roadway.

- Lane changes and other lateral movements are excluded; the analysis focuses solely on longitudinal platoon formation.

- In **Foundational model** and **MPS constraint model**, consecutive CAVs are assumed to automatically form a platoon.

- Platoon size is defined as the number of consecutive CAVs within a platoon (which are typically interspersed by HVs), on a single-lane road. HVs are treated as size-0 platoons.

- In **MPS constraint model**, when a platoon exceeds the MPS, the next CAV in line will serve as the leader of a new platoon.

- In **platooning willingness model**, each CAV is further assumed to have a probability w of forming the platoon with its leading vehicle.

# Models

- **Foundational model**: The probability of size-m CAV platoon follows: 
  $$
  P_m =
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \frac{1}{1 + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}}, & m = 0,\\[1em]
  \displaystyle \frac{P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^m \,(1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}})}{1 + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}}, & m \ge 1.
  \end{cases}
  $$
  
- **MPS constraint model**: When MPS is set as $$L$$:
  $$
    P'_{m'} =
    \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle \frac{1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^L}{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^L + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}, 
    & m' = 0, \\[1em]
    \displaystyle \frac{(1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}})\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{m'}}{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^L + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}, 
    & m' \in \{1,2,\dots,L-1\}, \\[1em]
    \displaystyle \frac{P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^L}{\,1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^L + P_{\mathrm{CAV}}\,}, 
    & m' = L.
    \end{cases}
  $$
  
- **Platooning willingness model**:
  $$
    P_m^{(w)} \;=
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle \frac{1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}}}{1 - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^2}, 
    & m = 0,\\[1em]
    \displaystyle \frac{(1 - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}})^2\,w^{\,m-1}\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^m}{1 - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^2}, 
    & m \in \{1,2,\dots\}\,.
    \end{cases}
  $$

- **MPS constraint & platooning willingness model**:
  $$
  P'^{(w)}_{m'} =
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle
  \frac{(1 - P_{\mathrm{CAV}})\,(1 - w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L})}
       {1 - w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L} + w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L+1} - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{2}}, 
  & m' = 0, \\[1em]
  \displaystyle
  \frac{(1 - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}})^{2}\,w^{\,m'-1}\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{\,m'}}
       {1 - w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L} + w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L+1} - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{2}}, 
  & m' \in \{1,2,\dots,L-1\}, \\[1em]
  \displaystyle
  \frac{(1 - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}})\,w^{\,L-1}\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{\,L}}
       {1 - w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L} + w^{L}P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{L+1} - w\,P_{\mathrm{CAV}}^{2}}, 
  & m' = L.
  \end{cases}
$$
